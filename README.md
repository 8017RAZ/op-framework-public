# op-framework-configs
A (most likely temporary) repository to store and modify config files for OP-FW clusters

# Changing Configs
To make changes to the configs, make a pull request and wait for approval. Only PRs made by the cluster's manager will be approved. if there's no conifg file for your cluster, create one following the layout of an already existing one.
